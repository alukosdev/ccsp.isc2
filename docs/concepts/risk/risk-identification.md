# Risk Identification

## Terminology

### Definitions

#### Risk Modeling

Risk modeling is based on an asset or a threat.

#### Risk Register

A risk register is a table to consolidate information about risks.

## Overview

Risk = Asset \* Threat \* Vulnerability \(in some cases, the asset is excluded but shouldn't be\)

What the above calculation displays is that if there is no threat, no there is no vulnerability. Likewise, if there is no vulnerability, there is no risk. Finally, if the asset has no value, there is also no risk.
