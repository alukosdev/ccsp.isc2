# Monitoring Risk

## Terminology

### Acronyms

| Acronym | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| KGI | Key Goal Indicator |
| KPI | Key Performance Indicator |
| KRI | Key Risk Indicator |

### Definitions

#### KGIs

KGIs are examined *after* the fact. For example:

- Did we meet our goal of 99.99% uptime?

#### KPIs

KPIs are examined *before* you meet your goals. For example:

- Our SLA states that we will have 99.99% uptime.
- Did we meet this SLA for the quarter?

If you did not meet your SLA for the quarter, you will likely not reach your performance goals for the year.

#### KRIs

KRIs are those items that will be the first things that let you know something is amiss. You need to identify and closely monitor the things that will most quickly alert you to a change in the risk environment. In cloud computing, this might be the announcement of the discovery of a new vulnerability that could impact your cloud provider.

KRIs examine what might cause you to not meet your performance. For example:

- You may receive alerts for processor utilization of 60% sustained for 5 minutes or longer on a particular server to detect a potential DoS attack.

The idea is that if you can receive an indication that a risk is about to materialize, you can proactively move to counter that risk so you can meet your goals.

## Overview

Risk monitoring is the process of keeping track of identified risks. It should be treated as an ongoing process and implemented throughout the system life cycle.

The most important elements of a risk monitoring system include the ability to:

- Clearly identify a risk
- Classify or categorize the risk
- Track the risk over time

There are three purposes of the risk-monitoring components:

- Determine the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses
- Identify risk-impacting changes
- Verify that planned risk responses are implemented and inline with organizational mission
