# Blockchain

## Models

### Private

A private blockchain is an invitation-only network governed by a single entity. Entrants to the network require permission to read, write or audit the blockchain. There can be different levels of access and information can be encrypted to protect commercial confidentiality

### Public

A public blockchain has an open network. The information is available in a public domain. Due to its permissionless nature, any party can view, read, and write data on the blockchain and the data is accessible to all. No particular participant has control over the data in a public blockchain.

### Consortium

A consortium blockchain operates in a semi-private manner. It requires permission to join, but it can be shared and utilized by numerous different organizations that are working together.

### Hybrid

A hybrid blockchain combines benefits of public and private blockchains: an application or service can be hosted on an independent permissioned blockchain while leveraging a public blockchain for security and settlement.
