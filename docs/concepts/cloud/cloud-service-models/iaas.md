# IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service

## Overview

IaaS offers only hardware and administration, leaving the customer responsible for the OS and other software.

IaaS consists of a facility, hardware, an abstraction layer, an orchestration \(core connectivity and delivery\) layer to tie together the abstracted resources, and APIs to remotely manage the resources and deliver them to consumers

IaaS allows the customer to install all software, including operating systems \(OSs\) on hardware housed and connected by the cloud vendor. In this model, the cloud provider has a datacenter with racks and machines and cables and utilities, and administers all these things. However, all logical resources such as software are the responsibility of the customer.

Some examples of IaaS would include datacenters that allow clients to load whatever operating system and applications they choose. The cloud provider simply supplies the compute, storage, and networking functions.

## Boundaries

#### Provider

The provider is responsible for the buildings and land that compose the datacenter; must provide connectivity and power; and creates and administers the hardware assets the customer's programs and data will ride on.

#### Customer

The customer, however, is in charge of everything from the operating system and up; all software will be installed and administered by the customer, and the customer will supply and manage all the data.
