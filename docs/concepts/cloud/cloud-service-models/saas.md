# SaaS

Software as a Service

## Overview

SaaS is a software delivery method that provides access to software and its functionality remotely as a web-based service. Allows organizations to access business functionality at a cost typically less than paying for licensed applications because SaaS pricing is based on a monthly fee.

SaaS includes everything listed in IaaS and PaaS, with the addition of software programs. The cloud vendor becomes responsible for administering, patching, and updating this software as well. The cloud customer is basically only involved in uploading and processing data on a full production environment hosted by the provider.

Within SaaS, two delivery models are currently used:

#### Hosted Application Management

The provider hosts commercially available software for customers and delivers it over the web

#### Software on Demand

The CSP gives customers network-based access to a single copy of an application created specifically for SaaS distribution

Some examples of SaaS would include things like customer relationship manager \(CRM\) software or accounting software hosted in the cloud. The provider takes care of all the infrastructure, compute, and storage needs as well as providing the underlying operating systems and the application itself. All of this is completely transparent to the end user who only sees the application they have purchased.

## Characteristics

- Overall reduction of costs

Risks impacting IaaS also affect SaaS:

- Personnel Threats
- External Threats \(malware, hacking, DoS/DDoS, MITM, etc.\)
- Lack of Specific Skillsets

Additionally, the risks impacting PaaS also affect SaaS:

- Interoperability Issues
- Persistent Backdoors
- Virtualization
- Resource Sharing

## Benefits

- Limited administration
- Always running latest version of software
- Standardized software distribution
- Global accessibility
