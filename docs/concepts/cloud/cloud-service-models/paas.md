# PaaS

Platform as a Service

## Overview

PaaS allows a way for customers to rent hardware, operating systems, storage, and network capacity over the Internet from a cloud service provider.

PaaS contains everything included in IaaS, with the addition of OSs. The cloud vendor usually offers a selection of OSs, so that the customer can use any or all of the available choices. The vendor will be responsible for patching, administering, and updating the OS as necessary, and the customer can install any software they deem useful.

:::info
Some examples of PaaS include hosting providers that offer not only infrastructure but systems already loaded with a hardened operating system such as Windows Server or a Linux distribution.

## Boundaries

#### Provider

The provider is responsible for installing, maintaining, and administering the OS\(s\).

#### Customer

The responsibilities for updating and maintaining the software will remain the customer's.

## Characteristics
