# Private Cloud

## Overview

> **NIST SP 800-145**
>
> The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for **exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns** \(e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations\). It **may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them**, and it **may exist on or off premises.**

A community cloud features infrastructure and processing owned and operated by an affinity group; disparate pieces might be owned or controlled by individuals or distinct organizations, but they come together in some fashion to perform joint tasks and functions.

Gaming communities might be considered community clouds. For instance, the PlayStation network involves many different entities coming together to engage in online gaming: Sony hosts the identity and access management \(IAM\) tasks for the network, a particular game company might host a set of servers that run digital rights management \(DRM\) functions and processing for a specific game, and individual users conduct some of their own processing and storage locally on their own PlayStations.
