# Hybrid Cloud

## Overview

> **NIST SP 800-145**
>
> The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures \(private, community, or public\) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability \(e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds\).

A hybrid cloud contains elements of the other models. For instance, an organization might want to retain some private cloud resources \(say, their legacy production environment, which is accessed remotely by their users\), but also lease some public cloud space as well \(maybe a PaaS function for DevOps testing, away from the production environment so that there is much less risk of crashing systems in operation\).

An example of a hybrid cloud environment might include a hosted internal cloud such as a SharePoint site with a portion carved out for external partners who need to access a shared service. To them it would appear as an external cloud; therefore, it would be operating as a hybrid.
