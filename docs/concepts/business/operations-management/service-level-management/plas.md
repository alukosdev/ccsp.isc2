## Overview

PLAs are an agreement whereby the cloud provider states the level and types of personal data protection\(s\) in place. A PLA would require the cloud provider to document expectations for the cloud customer's data security, which could be an explicit admission of liability for CSPs, which is why this typically isn't common.

The CSA allows for four items in a PLA:

1. A PLA requires the CSP to clearly describe the level of privacy and data protection that is undertaken to maintain with respect to the relevant data processing.
2. The CSP must adopt a common structure or outline of the PLAs in which it can promote a powerful global industry standard.
3. A PLA should offer a clear and effective way to communicate the level of data protection offered by a CSP.
4. The eventual goal for a PLA is to provide customers with a tool to baseline personal data protection legal requirements across an environment and to evaluate the data protection offered by different CSPs.
