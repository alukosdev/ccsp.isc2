Service-level management aims to negotiate agreements with various parties and to design services in accordance with the agreed-upon service-level targets. Typical negotiated agreements include:

- UCs are external contracts negotiated **between the organization and vendors or suppliers.**

## Operational Relationships

In relation to **change management:**

- Change management must approve changes to all SLAs as well as ensure that the legal function has a chance to review them and offer guidance and direction on the nature and language of the proposed changes prior to them taking place. There should never be a change that is allowed to take place to an SLA that governs a production system unless change management has approved the change first.
