### Definitions

#### Service Levels

Service levels indicate the minimum expected performance.

## Overview

The SLA will set specific, quantified goals for these services and their provision over a certain timeframe.

One use of the SLA is to determine whether a customer is actually receiving the services outlined in the SLA. An independent third-party can objectively affirm whether the requirements outlined in the SLA are being met.

The SLA should contain elements of the contract that can be subject to discrete, objective, repeatable, numeric metrics. For example:

- There will be no interruption of connectivity to data storage longer than three \(3\) seconds per calendar month.

SLAs are negotiated with **customers.**

- Assessment of risk environment
- Risk profile
- Risk appetite
- Responsibilities
- Regulatory requirements
- Risk mitigation
- Risk frameworks

An SLA typically includes items that can be measured quantitatively:

- *Availability*: What is the uptime?
- *Performance*: What is the response time?
- *Privacy of the data*: Does the data need to be encrypted?
- *Logging and reporting*: What needs to be logged?
- *DR expectations*: What is the RTO, RPO, and MTD?
- *Location of the data*: What regulations may dictate where the data is stored?
- *Data format and structure*: How will data be stored, saved, and retained?
- *Portability of the data*: Will data be maintained such that it can be moved among CSPs?
- *Identification and problem resolution*: Who is called when there are problems?
- *Change-management process*: What is the process for changes to be submitted and verified?
- *Dispute-mediation process*: Exit strategy with expectations on the provider to ensure a smooth transition.

Having an SLA separate from the contract allows the company to revise the SLA without revising the contract. The contract would then refer to the SLA. The term for the contract could be multiple 2-year periods while the SLA would be reviewed quarterly, for example. This reduces the need to engage legal for contract review.

I like to consider the SLA as the "performance contract" since it is more concerned with the performance-related aspects than the contract itself.
