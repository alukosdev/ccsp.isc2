# Contracts

## Terminology

### Definitions

#### Memorandum of Agreement/Understanding \(MOA/MOU\)

A *nonbinding* agreement between two or more parties outlining the terms and details of an understanding, including each parties' requirements and responsibilities.

#### Letter of Intent \(LOI\)

A LOI outlines the general plans of an agreement between two or more parties before a legal agreement is finalized.

## Overview

The contract will spell out all the terms of the agreement: what each party is responsible for, what form the services will take, how issues will be resolved, and so on. The contract will also state what the penalties are \(usually financial\) when the cloud provider fails to meet the SLA for a given period.

> The provider will ensure the customer has constant, uninterrupted access to the Customer's data storage resources. Customer's monthly fee will be waived for any period following a calendar month in which any service level has not been attained by the Provider.

From a contractual, regulated, and PII perspective, the following should be reviewed and fully understood with regard to any hosting contracts \(along with other overarching components within an SLA\):

- *Scope of processing.* Clear understanding of the permissible types of data processing should be provided. The specifications should also list the purpose for which the data can be processed or utilized.
- *Use of subcontractors.* Understanding where any processing, transmission, storage, or use of information will occur.
- *Deletion of data.* Where the business operations no longer require information to be retained for a specific purpose, the deletion of information should occur in line with the organizations data retention policies and standards.
- *Appropriate or required data security controls.* Where processing, transmission, or storage of data and resources is outsourced, the same level of security controls should be required for any entry's contracting or subcontracting services.
- *Locations of data.* Where information is being stored, processed, and transmitted in the event of daily actions or failover.
- *Return or restitution of data.* For both contractors and subcontractors where a contract is terminated, the timely and orderly return of data has to be required both contractually and within the SLA.
- *Right to audit subcontractors.* Right to audit clauses should allow for the organization owning the data \(not possessing\) to audit or engage the services of an independent party to ensure that contractual and regulatory requirements are being satisfied by either the contractor or the subcontractor.

At a minimum, you should ensure that your cloud service contract states that you must be notified in the event of a subpoena or other similar actions to ensure that you do not lose access to your data as a result of lawsuits.

Immediate notification from a CSP to a customer should be required for all security related events. This is especially true for security breaches. This should be explicitly addressed in the service contract between the client and the CSP and should be non-negotiable.
