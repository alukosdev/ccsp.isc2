### Definitions

#### Loss of Governance

The risk that the client cedes control to the cloud provider.

## Overview

Governance is the system by which the provisioning and usage of cloud services are directed and controlled. Governance defines actions, assigns responsibilities, and verifies performance. Governance includes the policy, process, and internal controls that comprise how an organization is run. Everything from the structures and policies to the leadership and other mechanisms for management.

Governance provides oversight, foundation, direction, and support for the organization as a whole. This includes policies, mission statements, how issues are addressed, and so on. The fact that any issue actually requires addressing is outline by governance. Governance identifies what the organization needs to do to please their stakeholders, prioritize performance vs. security, and so on.

## Corporate Governance

Corporate governance is a broad area describing the relationship between the shareholders and other stakeholders in the organization versus the senior management of the corporation.

## Third-Party Governance

Like our organization, CSPs also have governance. We do not want to sacrifice our governance in favor of theirs. For example, think of third-party governance for a CSP.

- Who reviews SLAs?
- How is this accomplished?
- Who reviews whether the metrics outlined in the SLA are actually being met?

Governance is making sure we have the right goals and that we have the supporting structure in place to achieve those goals. Do *we* have good third-party governance? Does our CSP have good governance?
