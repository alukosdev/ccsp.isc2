# Policies

## Overview

Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization.

The designing and implementing of security policies is carried out with input from senior management.

## Organizational Policies

Organizational policies take the form of those intended to reduce exposure and minimize risk of financial and data losses, as well as other types of damages such as loss of reputation.

Organizational policies form the basis of functional policies that can reduce the likelihood of the following:
